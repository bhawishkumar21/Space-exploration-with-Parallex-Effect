          <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting closest to the Sun at a distance
            of about 57.9 million kilometers. Despite its proximity to the Sun, it isn’t the hottest planet—Venus holds
            that title due to its thick atmosphere. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, called an exosphere, which
            cannot trap heat, causing extreme temperature variations between day and night. The planet completes an
            orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, but due to its slow rotation, one full day (from sunrise to
            sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days. Its surface is rocky and heavily cratered, resembling our Moon, and it
            has a large iron core that contributes to a weak magnetic field. Mercury has no moons and has been explored
            by NASA’s Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions, with the European-Japanese BepiColombo mission currently on its
            way for further study.</p>

          <p>Venus is the second planet in our solar system and is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its
            similar size and composition. However, it has a thick atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds
            of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet—even hotter than Mercury—reaching surface temperatures of
            around 465°C (869°F). Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning the
            Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. One day on Venus (one full rotation) takes about 243 Earth days,
            while a year is only 225 Earth days. Its surface is rocky and volcanic, hidden beneath dense clouds that
            trap heat through a strong greenhouse effect. Despite being inhospitable, Venus has been studied by many
            missions, including NASA’s Magellan and Europe’s Venus Express, revealing a fascinating but extreme
            environment.</p>

            organisms to breathe. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by water, making it unique among the planets.
            Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun, creating one year.
            It rotates once every 24 hours, giving us day and night. Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere protect it
            from harmful solar radiation and meteoroids. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, which affects ocean
            tides and stabilizes the planet's tilt. With a diverse climate and rich ecosystems, Earth is home to
            millions of species and continues to be a dynamic and ever-changing world.</p>

            atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons,
            and a huge canyon called Valles Marineris. A day on Mars, called a "sol," is just a little over 24 hours,
            and it takes 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and
            Deimos. Scientists are very interested in Mars because it once had liquid water and might have supported
            microbial life. Many missions, like NASA’s Perseverance rover, are exploring the planet to learn more about
            its past and whether humans could live there in the future.

            giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries. It has a very strong magnetic field and at
            least 95 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. Jupiter rotates very
            quickly—one day lasts just about 10 hours—but it takes about 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun. The planet has
            colorful bands and swirling clouds caused by strong winds and storms in its atmosphere. Because of its
            massive size and strong gravity, Jupiter plays an important role in protecting the inner planets by pulling

            most beautiful features in the solar system. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant, composed mainly of
            hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. It has a fast rotation—one day lasts about 10.7 hours—and it
            takes about 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Saturn has over 140 known moons,
            including Titan, which is larger than Mercury and has a thick atmosphere. Despite its large size, Saturn is
            the least dense planet—it would float in water if a big enough ocean existed! Scientists continue to study
            Saturn to understand more about its atmosphere, rings, and moons.

          <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its unique sideways rotation—it spins on its
            side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees. This makes its seasons extremely long and unusual. Uranus is
            an ice giant, made mostly of icy materials like water, methane, and ammonia, along with hydrogen and helium.
            The methane in its atmosphere gives the planet its bluish-green color. It is very cold, with temperatures
            dropping to around -224°C (-371°F), making it one of the coldest planets in the solar system. Uranus takes
            about 17 hours to complete a day and 84 Earth years to orbit the Sun. It has 13 faint rings and 27 known
            moons, named mostly after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus is mysterious
            and still not fully understood, as it has only been visited once—by NASA’s Voyager 2 in 1986.</p>

            strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of over 2,000 km/h (1,200 mph). It has a thick
            atmosphere made of hydrogen, helium, and methane, and it experiences giant storms, including one known as
            the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. A day on Neptune lasts about 16 hours, while it
            takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton
            being the largest—it orbits the planet in the opposite direction, suggesting it may have been captured. The

          <p>Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies and
            remnants from the early solar system. Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf
            planet by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 because it does not clear its orbit of other debris.
            Pluto is small—about one-sixth the width of Earth—and has a rocky, icy surface with mountains, valleys, and
            possible underground oceans. It has a thin atmosphere made mostly of nitrogen, which expands when it’s
            closer to the Sun and freezes when it moves farther away. A year on Pluto is very long—it takes about 248
            Earth years to orbit the Sun, and one day lasts about 6.4 Earth days. Pluto has five known moons, the
            largest being Charon, which is so big compared to Pluto that they’re often called a double dwarf planet
            system. NASA’s New Horizons mission provided the first close-up images of Pluto in 2015, revealing a
            surprisingly active and complex world.</p>
